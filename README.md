## Running locally (dev)

1) Create & activate a venv and install deps:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Run the GUI from the repo root:

```powershell
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\src\titansteelworks\gui.py
```

3) Build a Windows EXE (one-file) using the provided script:

```powershell
& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
.\packaging\build_exe.ps1
```

Notes:
- Keep your OpenAI API key out of source control; the app will prompt to save it to a local per-user `.env` when needed.
- Use `packaging/clean_build.ps1` to remove build artifacts.
